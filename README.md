### TBC

Things that i wanted to do but couldn't figure out....

* Couldn't use <form> because it kept clearing state so used <div> instead!
* Wanted to be able to set the deadline back to an empty string after submit to show the placeholder again but i just left it at 0 because it said it had to be a number.
